Clay Higgins has raised a total of $224,066.81 since January 01, 2017. Of that, it appears that he himself contributed no money.
A total of $133,408.97 came from itemized individual contributions, while another $12,977.84 remained unitemized.
While no Republican parties contributed funds, other committees contributed a total of $78,650 to Higgins' campaign.

Of what his campaign has raised thus far, Higgins has spent $205,716.12, and has approximately $44k on hand. 

Notably, the individual who has contributed the most to Higgins' campaign is not a Louisiana resident, but Brad Cox - the chairman of Cox Oil in Dallas, Texas. This year alone, Cox has given $10,800 in small amounts at a time.

Cox has reason to push his influence on a Louisiana congressman: since January 2004, Cox has purchased assets off the Louisiana shore. Cox Oil specializes in drilling and exploration services for oil and gas.

It is not surprising, then, that this is what Higgins has to say about the oil and gas industry:

"Congress has moved in the right direction earlier this year by revoking the 40 year ban on exports of oil and gas products. In my opinion, more can be done in DC to help the industry. Right now, we are locked in a global battle between Saudi-Arabia/OPEC and Russia--as well as a handful of other smaller countries like Brazil. America is involved in a global struggle to see who's going to control the future of oil and gas. Therefore it's crucial that our federal government create an environment which allows American oil/gas companies to compete without onerous federal restrictions that the other major players do not have to contend with. I've never met a Republican who wants dirty air and dirty water or who wants to destroy the earth. However, jobs and economic growth must come first. Obama's over-the-top restrictions on methane and carbon dioxide and his onerous limits on operating on federal land have hurt America."
