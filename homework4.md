## SHARKS: STILL NOT AS HORRIBLE AS HUMANS ##

In honor of Shark Week, here's something more educational than watching a CGI shark outswim Michael Phelps (c'mon, at least give us the animatronic megalodon from Jaws if that's where SW is going). 

Sharks are apex predators, armed with 50 teeth, serrated and all-the-better-to-eat-you-with - but here's the thing: they don't actually want to eat *you*. The data shows, out of (only!) 44 total attacks around the world this year, just 2 were fatal. And of the ones that have happened so far, one was because some guy thought itâ€™d be chill to lasso a shark, and at least one was the result of a shark selfie. #YOLO

Fun fact: Did you know in the 16th century, mariners called sharks 'sea-dogs'? Makes them seem a lot cuddlier, huh?

*NOTE - Hi Rachel! I wasn't sure if we were supposed to use the chartbuilder tool exclusively but I liked the formatting better via Excel, so that's what I went with. It was kinda smushing the data in chartbuilder. I've uploaded the chartbuilder img file as well, just in case you wanted to see it.*
