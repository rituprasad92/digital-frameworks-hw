**Pro-Gun, Pro-Oil Companies Are The Biggest Dollars Behind Clay Higgins' Campaign**

Clay Higgins, R-LA, has recieved at least $37,550 from companies affiliated with big oil, gas, off-shore drilling, and gun-related industries. As a freshman congressman, he's already made it clear that he is against Obama-era regulations on oil and gas; as a self-described staunch Constituionalist, he's also very against any gun control legislation. Looking at his campaign finances paints a clear picture of Higgins' interests - and who is interested in him.

Higgins has raised a total of $224,066.81 since January 01, 2017. Of that, it appears that he himself contributed no money (which is not too shocking since <a href="http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_724e87f2-bd8d-11e6-b830-07ed00aae23a.html"/>Higgins allegedly owes over $100,000 in child support</a>). A total of $133,408.97 came from itemized individual contributions, while another $12,977.84 remained unitemized. While no Republican parties contributed funds, other committees contributed a total of $78,650 to Higgins' campaign. Of what his campaign has raised thus far, Higgins has spent $205,716.12, and has approximately $44,000 on hand. 

Notably, the individual who has contributed the most to Higgins' campaign is not a Louisiana resident, but Brad Cox - the chairman of Cox Oil in Dallas, Texas. This year alone, Cox has given $10,800 in small amounts at a time.

Cox has reason to push his influence on a Louisiana congressman: since January 2004, Cox has purchased assets off the Louisiana shore. Cox Oil specializes in drilling and exploration services for oil and gas.

It is not surprising, then, that this is what Higgins has to say about the oil and gas industry:

"Congress has moved in the right direction earlier this year by revoking the 40 year ban on exports of oil and gas products," Higgins said in <a href="https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1135261/issue-position-protecting-american-energy#.WXaSQdPysfE"/>a January 2016 statement</a> on the issue of American energy. "America is involved in a global struggle to see who's going to control the future of oil and gas. Therefore it's crucial that our federal government create an environment which allows American oil/gas companies to compete without onerous federal restrictions that the other major players do not have to contend with. I've never met a Republican who wants dirty air and dirty water or who wants to destroy the earth. However, jobs and economic growth must come first. Obama's over-the-top restrictions on methane and carbon dioxide and his onerous limits on operating on federal land have hurt America." 

Higgins' second largest donation was a total of $8,500 from different executives at <a href="http://www.harveygulf.com/about.html"/>Harvey Gulf International Marine, LLC</a> - a company that provides off-shore supply and transport ships. While the Harvey Gulf website says they endeavor to provide no harm to "people, assets, or the environment," the company has a history of working with drilling rigs, 'large' offshore structures, subsea construction, and pipeline inspection. 

Higgins has also been funded by the NRA, which donated $2,500. But a heftier donation this year - $5,400 - came from Mr. Matt Busbice at Plano Synergy - a hunting gear company whose owners, the Busbices, also star on a reality TV show called "*Country Buck$*." 

The Busbice "clan" owns, per Plano Synergy's website, a "55,000-acre ranch (three times the size of Manhattan), a sportsman fantasy camp in Louisiana," that is their "testing ground" for new products. Their mission is to perfect their high-tech hunting innovations, family-style."

The Busbice family have found a fellow gun enthusiast in Higgins. Higgins, like many in his party, opposes gun control legislation, saying "we already have resonable limits on our 2nd Amendment rights. We already are a 'well regulated' militia. No one can argue with that." As is popular amongst pro-gun advocates, Higgins cites Chicago as an example of how gun control laws have failed.

"The modern hysteria over guns is another example of our weakened society," Higgins said during his 2016 campaign. "Guns weren't really regulated at all prior to the 60s in America. Throughout our history, prior to just 50 years ago, a child could purchase a gun from any seller, if daddy sent him with the money. Gun free zones are always the target of terrorists and criminals. The club in Orlando was a gun free zone. Illinois laws almost completely eliminate 2nd amendment rights, yet Chicago suffers one of the highest murder rates in the entire free world."

Overall, Higgins' campaign finances point to facts the congressman himself has already elucidated: he is a man who cares about freeing up big oil and gas companies and keeping the 2nd Amendment unchanged.
