1. General biographic information / past career

Clay Higgins was born Aug 24, 1961 (55 years old). He is the seventh of 8 children. Higgins grew up on a ranch near Covington, LA. He attended Lousiana State University and then served in the Army/Louisiana National Guard as a Military Police Officer (rank: E-6 Staff Sergeant). Higgins managed a car dealership after, then returned to serve as a street cop in 2004 at the Opelousas Police Department. Four years later, he resigned instead of receiving disciplinary action after striking a handcuffed suspect:

*The Opelousas Police Department’s Discipline Review Board found that "Clay Higgins used unnecessary force on a subject during the execution of a warrant and later gave false statements during an internal investigation. Although he later recanted his story and admitted to striking a suspect in handcuffs and later releasing him". - WIKIPEDIA*

He worked at the Port Barre Police Department afterwards for 3 years. In 2011, he moved to the St. Landry Parish Sheriffs Office. In October 2014, Higgins became the public information officer and was promoted to captain. In March 2016, Higgins became Reserve Deputy Marshal in Lafayette. Higgins has a history of unprofessional comments and actions during his time at the PD, including misusing his badge for personal gain. He resigned from the St. Landry PD, and in May 2016, ran for the 2016 Third District Election. He won in a runoff election on Dec 10 with 56.1 percent of the votes.

Higgins is a Republican who supports Trump and calls himself a Constitutionalist, focusing on defense, free markets, and smaller government. He supported the travel ban, and notably, on June 5 he posted this statement about Islamic terrorists:
*“Not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted any measure of quarter. Their intended entry to the American homeland should be summarily denied. Every conceivable measure should be engaged to hunt them down. Hunt them, identify them, and kill them. Kill them all. For the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all.”*

2. Personal Life

Higgins has been married 4 times. A child support lawsuit was filed against him during his campaign, alleging he has $140,000 in unpaid child support.

*Higgins claimed that winning the election would help him to pay the child support arrears, but to this date has failed to make the promised child support payments. Higgins has been married four times and has failed to abide by a Texas Court Ordered Child Support, thus the lawsuit filed for non-payment. To date, Higgins has not paid his child support debt to his ex-wife. His attorney is claiming that he is too 'busy' now. - WIKIPEDIA*
